Based on "A Path to the Minimum Viable Product" at https://steveblank.com/2021/04/20/the-secret-to-the-minimum-viable-product/

[Steve Blank](https://steveblank.com) first met Shawn Carolan and his wife Jennifer at the turn of the century at 11,000 feet. He was hiking with his kids between the Yosemite High Sierra camps. Having just retired from a career as an entrepreneur he had started thinking about why startups were different from large companies. 

"The ideas were bouncing around my head so hard that I shared them with these strangers around a campfire, drawing out the four steps with a stick in the dirt." "Shawn immediately said the name I had given the four steps was confusing – I had called it market development – he suggested that I call it Customer Development – and the name stuck." What he didn’t realize was that both were graduate students at Stanford and later both would become great VCs – Shawn at Menlo Ventures and Jennifer at Reach Capital. (And Jennifer is now his co-instructor in the Stanford Lean LaunchPad class.)
